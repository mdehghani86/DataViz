# Data Visualization Using Python

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Data Visualization Using Python! This repository contains files and code examples for a tutorial on how to create data visualizations using Python.

**Overview**
The tutorial covers several popular Python libraries for creating data visualizations, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The code examples are provided in Google Colab Notebooks, which can be run locally on your machine or on a cloud-based service like Google Colab.

**Libraries Covered**
Here are the libraries covered in this tutorial:

1. Matplotlib: A popular plotting library for creating static, publication-quality visualizations.
2. Seaborn: A higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib, designed for creating more complex visualizations with less code.
3. Plotly: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this tutorial, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. We recommend using Python 3.7 or later.

You will also need to install the following libraries:

Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager. Here is an example command for installing Matplotlib:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

Once you have the required libraries installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/mdehghani86/DataViz.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your machine.

**Running the Code Examples**
To run the code examples in this tutorial, you will need to open the Jupyter Notebook. You can do this by navigating to the folder in your terminal and running the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.
Alternatively you can use Google Colab to run the notebooks

**Contributing**
If you find any issues with the code examples or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on this repository or submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from the students!
